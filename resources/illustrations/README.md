## Diversity of illustrations

It is our main goal to be a inclusive and diverse community.
This includes representing a wide range of **cultures**, **backgrounds**, and **perspectives** in our illustrations.
We strive to create visuals that resonate with and are accessible to everyone, ensuring that all people feel seen and valued.
Whenever you assume that a ressource needs more variations based on your unique experiences and viewpoints please [open an issue](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/issues/new).
We will be happy to work with you on the issue to let our all our resources truly **reflects the diversity of our world**.

# Hiero Becomes the First Graduated Project under LFDT’s New Project Lifecycle Framework — and the First to Achieve Graduation since LFDT’s Expanded Umbrella"

We are proud to announce that **Hiero** has officially reached **graduated status** within the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT), becoming both the **first project to do so under LFDT’s new project lifecycle framework** — and the **first project to achieve graduation under the newly expanded LFDT umbrella organization**.

This dual milestone underscores Hiero’s technical,contributor diverisity and governance maturity while also signaling the growing strength of LFDT as a foundation dedicated to advancing decentralized trust.

---

## A Year of Milestones

Since its launch in September 2024, Hiero has grown into a thriving, vendor-neutral project:

- **Community Governance:** In June 2025, open elections expanded the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), with Michael Kantor (Contributor seat) and Milan Wiercx Van Rhijn (End User seat) joining.
- **Expanding Participation:** Nearly 800 contributors from 80+ organizations and 50+ adopters are actively shaping Hiero.
- **Engineering Excellence:** Hiero’s 28 repositories follow Apache 2.0/MIT licensing, CI/CD pipelines, OpenSSF Scorecard compliance, and transparent governance under LFDT.
- **Cross-Foundation Collaboration:** Hiero has partnered with the OpenWallet Foundation and Hyperledger AnonCreds to advance privacy-preserving decentralized identity, delivering the Hedera ACA-Py plugin, the Hiero DID SDK for Python, and expanding support for interoperable, open identity tooling.
- **Global Presence:** From LFDT webinars to the Global Digital Collaboration Conference in Geneva, Hiero has showcased real-world use cases like cross-border payments and verifiable credentials anchored to Hedera.

---

## Why Graduation Matters

Graduation confirms that Hiero has achieved LFDT’s highest standards for:

- **Neutral governance** and diverse community leadership
- **Production readiness** with enterprise-grade deployments (including powering the Hedera mainnet since February 2025)
- **Security and compliance** with OpenSSF, GitHub Insights, and CI/CD best practices
- **Growing adoption** by enterprises, developers, and public sector innovators

---

## Real-World Adoption

- **Hedera:** Since February 2025, Hedera has been powered entirely by Hiero’s open codebase, making it the largest public network based on an LFDT project.
- **HashSphere:** Enables enterprises and governments to run private Hiero-based networks with Hedera compatibility.
- **Ecosystem Tools:** Wallets like HashPack, platforms like Hgraph, and developer tooling from Hashgraph Online extend Hiero’s reach.
- **Use Cases:** Hiero is already enabling breakthroughs in cross-border payments (reducing costs from $40 to $0.10 and delays from a week to under a minute) and supply chain transparency (eliminating data mismatches and single points of control).

---

## Community-Contributed Projects

Hiero’s graduation is not just about maturity — it’s about momentum. In its first year under LFDT, Hiero has welcomed a wave of **community-contributed projects**, each expanding the ecosystem:

- **Hiero SDK in Python** — Native Python SDK published to PyPI for managing tokens, consensus transactions, and DIDs.
- **Hiero Solo Action** — GitHub Action to spin up a Hiero Solo test network inside CI/CD pipelines.
- **GoMint API** — Open source API layer for authentication, token management, custodial keys, and consensus services.
- **Hashgraph Online Standards SDK** — Reference implementations for Hashgraph Consensus Standards (HCS-1, HCS-10, HCS-11, and more), including demos for AI agent communication and decentralized file storage.
- **Hedera Smart Contracts** — EVM system contract library exposing Hedera Token Service, Account Service, PRNG, and Exchange Rate features to Solidity developers.
- **Hederium** — A Go implementation of the Hashio protocol, developed by LimeChain, bringing reliability, performance, and scalability to distributed applications.
- **hiero-cli** — The official command-line interface for Hedera and Hiero, automating accounts, tokens, topics, smart contracts, and CI/CD workflows.

These projects reflect the **collaborative DNA of LFDT**: open participation, vendor neutrality, and ecosystem-wide innovation.

## Looking Ahead

Hiero’s graduation sets a precedent: it proves that LFDT’s new lifecycle framework and rebranded identity can foster projects that are technically mature, community-governed, and ecosystem-rich.

From identity to finance, supply chains to sustainability, and from SDKs to smart contracts, Hiero is laying the foundation for a new generation of decentralized trust.

We invite developers, enterprises, and governments to join us in building with Hiero:

- Explore the project: https://hiero.org
- Get started: https://docs.hiero.org
- Join the community: https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org

**The future of decentralized trust is open — and with Hiero’s graduation, LFDT has proven its ability to grow and nurture open source projects while cultivating the communities that allow them to thrive.**
